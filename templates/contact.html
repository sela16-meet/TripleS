Hello there! We are a group of Palestinian and Israeli teenagers in a program called MEET.
We have been studying computer science and business management for 3 years now, and we've decided that it's finally time for us to create our own project :) <br><br>
So after many debates and a lot of Toffi, we have decided to devote our project to stereotypes and most importantly-breaking the damn thing!!!
So we invite you to share with us your OWN stories (either real or made up) that take us a step closer to our vision- A world where society defies social expectations ---> shiranfo@walla.com
